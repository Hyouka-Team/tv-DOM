    TV Show Project - Part 1/3

    In this weeks project we will be using the knowledge we learnt from JS1 & JS2 to build the first version of our website.

    You must make a web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which shows details of all of the episodes ofÂ  a TV show.

    ***for this week, you just need to display episodes of 1 tv show; you can choose one of these apis:

    â€¢ Game Of Thrones : https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/82/episodes

    â€¢ The Sopranos :
    https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/527/episodes

    â€¢ Planet Earth II : https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/22036/episodes

    â€¢ True Detective : https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/5/episodes

    â€¢ Fresh Prince : https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/582/episodes

    â€¢ The Wire : https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/179/episodes

    â€¢ Mythbusters : https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/379/episodes

    â€¢ Scrapheap Challenge : https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/4729/episodes

    For this assignment you should do these steps: 
    â€¢ New repo created 
    â€¢ New repo is named EXACTLY tv-show-dom-project 
    â€¢ Repo is NOT a fork 
    â€¢ Repo has the starter content (index.html, etc) 
    â€¢ Repo cloned locally 
    â€¢ Published site is visible at https://aps-[[github-username]]-tv.netlify.app/

    #LEVEL 100:

    â€¢ All episodes must be shown 
    â€¢ For each episode, AT LEAST following must be displayed: 
    â€¢ the episode's name 
    â€¢ the season number 
    â€¢ the episode number 
    â€¢ the episode's medium-sized image 
    â€¢ the episode's summary text 
    â€¢ You should combine season number and episode number into an episode code: 
    â€¢ Each part should be zero-padded to two digits.
    â€¢ Example: S02E07 would be the code for the 7th episode of the 2nd season. S2E7 would beÂ  
    incorrect. 
    Your page should state somewhere that the data has (originally) come from TVMaze.com, and link backÂ  
    to that site (or the specific episode on that site). See tvmaze.com/api#licensing.


    #LEVEL 200: 
    â€¢ Complete all requirements from Level 100 
    â€¢ Add a "live" search input: 
    â€¢ Only episodes whose summary OR name contains the search term should be displayed 
    â€¢ The search should be case-insensitive 
    â€¢ The display should update immediately after each keystroke changes the input. 
    â€¢ Display how many episodes match the current search 
    â€¢ If the search box is cleared, all episodes should be shown. 
    â€¢ If you have been fetching the episode data from the API, be careful not to cause many frequentÂ  
    requests with this search feature. The search should look through an in-memory copy of theÂ  
    episode list. Do not fetch the data again each time something is typed!


    #LEVEL 300: 
    â€¢ Add an Episode Selector 
    â€¢ Complete all requirements from level 200 
    â€¢ Add a select input which allows you to jump quickly to an episode: 
    â€¢ The select input should list all episodes in the format: "S01E01 - Winter is Coming" 
    â€¢ When the user makes a selection, they should be taken directly to that episode in the list 
    â€¢ Bonus: if you prefer, when the select is used, ONLY show the selected episode. If you do this, beÂ  
    sure to provide a way for the user to see all episodes again.

    good luckðŸ˜ˆ
